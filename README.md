Processing Video
================

Repository of the video library for Processing. Forked by alexstamm

This library comprises classes for movie playback and video capture. It is based on the [gstreamer multimedia framework](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/), and uses the [gst1-java-core](https://github.com/gstreamer-java/gst1-java-core) bindings to interface gstreamer from Java.

Updates to this library include:

- Updated GStreamer modules, gst1-java-core, and JNA
- Updated LibraryLoader to incorporate new GStreamer .dlls
- Utilizing native buffer
- Improved camera capture functionality
- Multicamera support, allows cameras of the same name to be used
- Improved frame scrubbing
- Info display for bundled vs system GStreamer installs
